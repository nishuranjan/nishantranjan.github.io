## Who Am I?

I am Data Enthusiast. I want to actively participate in an end-to-end Data project, meeting the business expectations of your customers covering all phases from data acquisition, storage, processing of massive amounts of data, work together with your Data Engineers, Cloud engineer and Data Architects.

I enjoy the variety and technology challenges of large-scale projects. To reach these challenge, I have three skills that I can bring to your company. 

So my first competency, is related to modelling, econometrician and machine learning algorithm implementing. 

Secondly, I am endowed with a transversal vision of data analytics, Business Intelligence and programming.

This vision relies on my capacity to make the link between the functional parts and the technical parts during the development of a new software.

I am also meticulous in technology choice and optimised solutions.

Thirdly, I have an agile mind promising business value of team building tapping into the collective intelligence of the team members.

I conducted and lead several machine learning projects such as processing end-to-end Proof of Concept implementing time-series architecture DataLake, data collection, and building predictive algorithms and anomaly detection and imbalance target algorithms to analyse and solve complex business problems.

I love the challenges of growing startups and I currently lead product development projects using data.
