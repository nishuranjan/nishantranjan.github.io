title: Neurobic Exercises
---

Exercising your mind helps you be your mental best now while it protects against future memory loss and cognitive decline.

Though you can’t expect to get all of the following benefits from any one activity, brain exercise is reported to help in all these areas:

- less stress
- better memory
- more positive mood
- increased focus and concentration
- boost in motivation and productivity
- enhanced fluid intelligence, creativity, and mental flexibility
- faster thinking and reaction time
- greater self-confidence
- sharper vision and hearing

Let’s review some of the best activities that have repeatedly been proven to support cognitive and mental health.

Remember, these and any good brain exercises are novel and complex.

Neurobic exercises

1. Switch Hands

If you are right-handed, try using your left hand to do things like brushing your teeth, eating, and using your computer mouse.

Using your non-dominant hand results in increased brain activity.

This can be very hard at first which is why it gives your brain a good workout.

2. Eat with Chopsticks

This will force you to eat mindfully which is good for your brain, digestion and calorie consumption.

(If you’re already good at this, use your non-dominant hand instead.)

3. Do Chores with Your Eyes Closed

When taking a shower, washing your hair, or sorting laundry, try doing it with your eyes closed.

This will force your brain to use new neural pathways.

Obviously, don’t do anything with your eyes closed that could put you or others in danger.

4. Do Things Upside Down or Backwards

No worries, you don’t have to stand on your head for this one.

Stimulate your brain by looking at things upside down.

An easy one to start with is wearing your watch upside down.

This forces your brain to really think every time you glance at your watch. 

You can also hang clocks or calendars upside down.

 When you get used to that, you can graduate to using your phone, or whatever else you can imagine, upside down.

 Or you can channel your inner Leonardo da Vinci and try mastering the art of writing backwards, known as mirror writing.

 5. Read Books Aloud

Take turns reading and listening to a book with your significant other, a friend, or a child.

 If that’s not feasible, alternate reading with listening to audiobooks.

 This engages the imagination in a different way.

 One of the earliest demonstrations of brain imaging clearly showed three distinct brain regions lighting up when the same word was read, spoken, or heard.

 6. Take New Routes

On a routine commute, your brain is on autopilot and gets very little stimulation.

 But taking an unfamiliar route activates the cortex and hippocampus.

 It has been said that Bill Gates would drive a different route on the way home from work each day to stimulate his brain, and look where that got him!

 There’s no need to stick to driving.

 You can take new routes when walking, biking, or riding public transportation.

7. Simultaneously Use All Your Senses

Try activities that simultaneously engage all your senses.

Travel, camping, and gardening are high on Dr. Katz’s list of activities that utilize all your senses in new ways.

One of his favorite examples is shopping at a farmer’s market where you can look, touch, sniff, and taste the produce.

Being sociable and talking with the farmer who grew your food provides additional brain stimulation.

8. Try New Things

Do things you’ve never done before.

Travel somewhere you’ve never been.

Check out an unfamiliar ethnic cuisine.

Try a hobby that is totally out of character for you.

If you are a couch potato, sign up for a dance class.

If you are athletic, try needlepoint.

Novel experiences trigger the release of dopamine, the “motivation” neurotransmitter.

It also stimulates the creation of new neurons.

9. Challenge Yourself with Mastery

Learning something new stimulates brain activity.

But as soon as you master it, the mental benefit stops because your brain becomes more efficient at the activity.

The only way to continue to stimulate your brain is to give it new challenges and stay out of your comfort zone.

So once you master something, challenge yourself with the next level of difficulty or learn a related skill.

For this reason, pursuits like learning languages, playing musical instruments, or chess are ideal brain exercises because there is always more to learn.

10. Do Things the Hard Way

The most obvious way to do things the hard way is to stop relying on technology.

Use your brain instead of your smartphone for basic mental skills like spelling and math.

Impress your friends by memorizing their phone numbers (gasp!).

Turn off the GPS and learn to read a map and use your innate sense of direction to find your way around instead.

London cab drivers give their brains a tremendous workout by building a map of London in their heads.

They must memorize 25,000 streets and 20,000 landmarks to get their license.

Research found that the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for storing and organizing memories, in a typical London cabbie is significantly larger than average.

11. Connect With Different People

Any time you connect with others, you expose yourself to new ideas and other ways of thinking about things.

But you can get even more brain benefits from spending time with people unlike you.

Intentionally seek out others with different interests, careers, or skill sets or those who are from different social or cultural environments.

This opens you up to new perspectives and ideas.

This challenge to your current way of thinking stimulates mental growth.

12. Start Meditating

It’s estimated that over 18 million Americans meditate.

Mayo Clinic, Harvard, and the National Institutes of Health extol its many benefits.

Major corporations like Google, General Mills, Target, Apple, Nike, Procter & Gamble and AOL offer structured meditation programs for executives and encourage employees at all levels to do it.

The US military finds meditation helps troops deal with stress, improves their cognitive resilience, and increases their ability to focus.

But is meditation really exercising your mind?

Here’s why meditation makes it onto our list of top brain exercises.

Of all mental exercises, meditation may be the most challenging and therefore the best.

Our brains are non-stop thinking machines that pour out upwards of 70,000 thoughts daily.

And 95% of these thoughts are the same thoughts day in, day out.

Training your mind to be quiet can be hard work!

Meditation works so much like exercise, it’s been called “pushups for the brain.”

Over 1,000 published studies have demonstrated the health benefits of meditation.

The brain benefits of meditation include stress reduction, improved memory, learning ability and mood, increased focus and attention, and even reversal of brain atrophy.

13. Get Physical Exercise

No discussion about brain exercise would be complete without emphasizing how important physical exercise is for the brain.

Physical exercise might just be the most important thing you can do to keep your brain in good shape.

It may be even more important than using your brain to think!

Exercise reduces stress by increasing the feel-good brain chemicals serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.

It increases the levels of brain chemicals that promote new brain cell formation and new neural connections.

It protects against mental decline and reduces the risk of dementia.

Exercise improves circulation and sends more oxygen to your oxygen-hungry brain.

Exercising for brain health doesn’t need to be strenuous.

Walking is particularly beneficial for the brain as are exercises with a strong mind-body connection like yoga and tai chi.

14. Take Up a Creative Hobby

Craft hobbies may not be high art, but they are finally getting more attention for another reason.

They have the power to focus the brain similarly to meditation.

They act as a natural antidepressant and may protect against brain aging.

knitting brain exercise Knitting, particularly, got a big thumbs-up recently.

In a large study of more than 3,500 knitters, over 80% of those with depression reported feeling happy when they knitted.

Another study found that “purposeful activities” such as music, drawing, meditation, reading, arts and crafts, and doing home repairs specifically stimulated the neurological system and enhanced health and mental well-being.

If you’re like the average American, you spend 10 hours every day staring at screens.

Carve out a little time to try one of these brain-boosting hobbies instead:

camping
craft hobbies of all kinds
creating any form of art
creative writing
dancing
gardening
geocaching
learning a second language
martial arts
playing a musical instrument
playing chess or Scrabble
scrapbooking
traveling
15. Use Apps that Exercise Your Brain in Unexpected Ways

I know, I’ve been telling you to put down your electronics a little more.

But, let’s face it — few of us will!

So here’s a way technology can exercise your brain.

Most online brain training programs like Lumosity and Fit Brains have app versions of their brain games.

But we prefer apps that use real life skills to stimulate your mind instead.

Get your daily dose of culture with Daily Art app.

This app shares interesting background stories about one painting masterpiece every day.

TED iPad app allows you to create your own playlists of talks from the world’s most innovative thinkers.

Khan Academy allows you to “learn almost anything for free” with a series of more than 10,000 educational videos that cover math, science, economics and the humanities.

Khan Academy can help you with grammar but it doesn’t teach foreign languages.

You can download Duolingo for that.

This app will help you learn Spanish, French, or many other foreign languages for free.

And there’s a version to help you brush up on your English if it’s not your native language.

At Chess.com you can learn or master chess either on your computer or phone.

Brain Exercises: The Bottom Line

Your brain thrives on variety to keep those synapses firing.

Exercise your brain with activities that are novel, challenging, and complex.

The more kinds of mentally stimulating activities you engage in, the happier and healthier your brain will be.

We’ve shown you many ways to incorporate brain exercise of all kinds into your life.

You are limited only by your imagination!

Above all, remember that learning real life skills is a better way to enhance your brain power.

Computerized brain training is optional.
